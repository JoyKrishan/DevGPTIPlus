# ChatGPT Usage and Code Dependence in Issue-Tracker Systems

## Data
The `data` folder contains the dataset and results:

- `dataset/DevGPTIPlus.json`: Contains the DevGPTIPlus dataset in JSON format.
- `commits/`: Contains all the issues with commits and their corresponding GPT-generated code (if any).

### Research Questions (RQs) Results

- **RQ1**: Contains the results of our open coding.
- **RQ2**: Contains the results of BerTopic modeling, including topics, key representations, and relevant documents, which we manually analyzed to determine the major categories.
- **RQ3**: Contains the results of XML files generated by CPD, which we manually analyzed.
- **RQ4**: Contains all the sentiment analysis for overall, usage-based and topic-based.
## Code Structure

The `src` folder contains all the code used to generate the data:

- `data_collection/`: Contains the data retrieval from GitHub REST API and filtering.
- `rq1_usage/`: Contains the implementation for RQ1.
- `rq2_topic/`: Contains the implementation for RQ2.
- `rq3_code_reliance/`: Contains the implementation code for RQ3.
- `rq4_sentiment/`: Contains the implementation code for RQ4.
