## On AI language models

**Generative AI language models like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Bard DO NOT know how to write proper extensions for TurboWarp.** Remember that the ChatGPT knowledge cutoff is in 2021 while our extension system did not exist until late 2022, thus it *literally can't know*. Pull requests submitting extensions that are made by AI (it's really obvious) will be closed as invalid.
