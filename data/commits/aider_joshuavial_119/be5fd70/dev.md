```bash
./docker-build
```

This will build a Docker image named `aider`.

## Starting the Docker Container

To start the Docker container, run the following command:

```bash
./docker-start
```

This will start a Docker container from the `aider` image. The current directory will be mounted into the `/app` directory in the container.
