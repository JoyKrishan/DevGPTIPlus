# This bash command retrieves information about desktops in a BSPWM setup using bspc (Binary Space Partitioning Control) and jq (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor).
# The bspc command is used to query the state of the BSPWM window manager and retrieve information about desktops.
# The output of bspc is then processed using jq to extract specific data and format it for further use.

# The first part of the jq command processes the JSON output from bspc:
# - '.monitors[0].desktops[]' selects desktops from the first monitor.
# - '.root // {}' uses the '.root' key if it exists, otherwise provides an empty object '{}'.
# - '[.[] | recurse | select(.instanceName?) | .instanceName]' recursively searches for objects with an 'instanceName' key and retrieves their values.
# - 'join("; ")' joins the 'instanceName' values with a semicolon.

# The second part of the jq command further processes the JSON output:
# - '-s' option is used to read the entire input JSON stream into a JSON array.
# - '-c' option is used to output the JSON array as a single line, ensuring it's compact.

# The processed output is then appended to a file located at /dev/shm/bspeww/desktops/data using the '>>' operator.
