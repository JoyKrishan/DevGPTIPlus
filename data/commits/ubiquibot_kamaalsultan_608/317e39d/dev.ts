            "I need your help to find duplicate issues on my GitHub repository. For context, the entire strategy is the following:\n\n1. A new issue is posted\n2. We ask you to extract a word list of the most \"important\" (i.e. unique adjectives?) words.\n3. We search the repository for all issues with the important words.\n4. We go from highest issue number (most recent) and read the issue description.\n5. If >80% confidence that it's a redundant issue, stop the search and link back to it with a warning saying that it's likely to be a duplicate.\nRight now, we are on step 2.\n") +
