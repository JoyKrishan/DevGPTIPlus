        Executes a given Cypher query on the Neo4j database.

            query results.Each dictionary is a record in the query result.

        Executes a write transaction using a given Cypher query on the Neo4j database.
        This method should be used for queries that modify the database, such as CREATE,
        UPDATE, or DELETE operations.
            query (str): The Cypher query string to be executed.
