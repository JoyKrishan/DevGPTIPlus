Developers love certainty, it's important for them to know what projects they'll be working on in-between client projects. Knowing in advance what projects they'll be working on minimizes the time it takes to get up to speed on a project as they could be looped into communications for the project before they start so they have some recent context when they join.
As you can imagine there is a lot of information that would be required for a Bench Master to be effective. The following would be useful for a Bench Master to have:
- **Developers and their skills** - Your CRM likely has this information already
    - see https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/search-employee-skills/
- **Developer client bookings** - You can get this information from your staffing report, 
    - see https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/know-where-your-staff-are/
    - see https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/report-bugs-and-suggestions/#tip-5-do-you-make-it-easy-to-find-all-the-backlog-in-your-company
This covers the basics of what a Bench Master would need to know, there is other factors that would influence the Bench Master's decisions such as developer personal goals. For example, if a developer wants to learn React, the Bench Master could try place the developer on a project that uses React.

Here are some considerations the Bench Master would keep in mind for every developer:
1. Client needs - Is there any client work that tentatively needs the developer?
2. Time between now and next client?
3. Inbox count? 
    - see https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/dones-is-your-inbox-a-task-list-only/
4. Current skillset
5. Personal Development Time 
     - Check Long Term goal tracker e.g. Trello board, anything important? Anything doable in the time between now and next client?
     - Are there any languages you want to learn? "I want to learn Blazor please" (Bench Master puts person on Blazor project)
6. Internal Projects - What is most important? 
7. Internal Projects - What teams are looking for a Dev?
Ensuring seamless continuity of operations in the absence of the Bench Master is essential.
**Tip:** If you have multiple offices, consider having a backup Bench Master that covers each timezone you have an office location

- Long projects (>4 weeks) with >3 active developers should be run as a separate team. Every standalone project should have a Product Champion. 
- Other projects should form a single team. This team is Scrum Mastered by the Bench Master. This allows the developers to maintain adapted process ceremonies and while still working on different products, see [Do you ensure your client projects who don't use full Scrum, at least have a "Mini-Review"?](/who-dont-use-full-scrum-should-have-a-mini-review). This team should adapt the standard Scrum emails ([Do you create a Sprint Review/Retro email?](/do-you-create-a-sprint-review-retro-email)) to send a collective email to internal stakeholders after every sprint. This team should still do a retro as the nature of their more ad-hoc environment will help them be more effective.
