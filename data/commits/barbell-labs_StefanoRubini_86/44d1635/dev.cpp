// Function definition for _88MPH, which finds a path through charging stations considering battery constraints
    // Initialize an empty stack to store the path
    // Declare a string variable to store the name of the current station
    // Initialize variables to store battery charge and other parameters
    // If the initial battery is zero or negative, return an empty path
    // Charge the battery based on the charging station's power
    // If the battery charge exceeds 75.5, return an empty path
    // If the battery charge is between 62.5 and 75.5 (inclusive), push the starting location onto the path and return
    // Iterate over neighbors of the starting location in the map of charging stations
        // Extract neighbor's station name and distance
        // Calculate battery decrease based on distance traveled
        // Recursively call _88MPH function with updated parameters
        // If a non-empty path is found, push the starting location onto the path and break the loop
    // Return the resulting station path
