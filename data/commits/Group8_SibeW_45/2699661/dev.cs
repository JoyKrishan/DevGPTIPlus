        /* Syntax: Serialize Field
         * 
         * This attribute tells Unity to serialize the field, 
         * meaning it should be shown in the Unity editor 
         * and its value should be saved when the scene is saved. 
         * Serialized fields can be accessed and modified in the Unity editor, 
         * allowing developers to configure them without changing the code.
         */
        /* Syntax:Tooltip
         * 
         * This part of the attribute provides a tooltip 
         * that appears when hovering over the field in the Unity editor. 
         * It's a descriptive text that helps developers understand the purpose 
         * of the field without needing to reference additional documentation. 
         * In this case, it clarifies that the field represents 
         * the movement type that will be activated when the scene starts.
