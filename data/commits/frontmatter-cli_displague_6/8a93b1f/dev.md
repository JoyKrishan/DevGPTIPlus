Linting should be verified by running `just lint`. There are currently no tests, so `just test` is expected to fail.

In addition to the development supporting packages that will be installed by `just`, you may need to install the following:

- [just](https://github.com/casey/just#installation)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) `pip install pre-commit`
